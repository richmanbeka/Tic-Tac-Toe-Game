## 🧩 How to Play
1. Choose **Player vs Player** or **Player vs Computer**.
2. Enter player names (optional).
3. Click on a cell to make your move.
4. Game detects **win** or **draw** automatically.
5. Use **New Game** to restart the board or **Reset Score** to clear scores.


## 🧠 AI Logic (Single Player Mode)
1. **Win if possible** – the AI checks if it can win immediately.
2. **Block opponent** – prevents the player from winning.
3. **Priority moves** – chooses center > corners > sides if no win/block available.
